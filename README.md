# Mini Workshop: Data Viz with Tableau
This repo contains materials used for the TAR UC Workshop Data Viz with Tableau on 2021-06-02.
In the mini workshop, I've shared about data visualization and introduced basic features of data viz using tableau.

## Data Source
Credit to my mother who manually jotted down figures day by day since early of this year. And I filled up the 2020 figures from [ynshung and team](https://github.com/ynshung/covid-19-malaysia), thank you very much for initiating the effort!
